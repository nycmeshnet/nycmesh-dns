# Read metrics from one or many prometheus clients
[[inputs.prometheus]]
  ## An array of urls to scrape metrics from.
  urls = ["http://localhost:9100/metrics"]

  ## Metric version controls the mapping from Prometheus metrics into Telegraf metrics.
  ## See "Metric Format Configuration" in plugins/inputs/prometheus/README.md for details.
  ## Valid options: 1, 2
  # metric_version = 1

  ## Url tag name (tag containing scrapped url. optional, default is "url")
  # url_tag = "url"

  ## Whether the timestamp of the scraped metrics will be ignored.
  ## If set to true, the gather time will be used.
  # ignore_timestamp = false

  ## An array of Kubernetes services to scrape metrics from.
  # kubernetes_services = ["http://my-service-dns.my-namespace:9100/metrics"]

  ## Kubernetes config file to create client from.
  # kube_config = "/path/to/kubernetes.config"

  ## Scrape Kubernetes pods for the following prometheus annotations:
  ## - prometheus.io/scrape: Enable scraping for this pod
  ## - prometheus.io/scheme: If the metrics endpoint is secured then you will need to
  ##     set this to 'https' & most likely set the tls config.
  ## - prometheus.io/path: If the metrics path is not /metrics, define it with this annotation.
  ## - prometheus.io/port: If port is not 9102 use this annotation
  # monitor_kubernetes_pods = true

  ## Get the list of pods to scrape with either the scope of
  ## - cluster: the kubernetes watch api (default, no need to specify)
  ## - node: the local cadvisor api; for scalability. Note that the config node_ip or the environment variable NODE_IP must be set to the host IP.
  # pod_scrape_scope = "cluster"

  ## Only for node scrape scope: node IP of the node that telegraf is running on.
  ## Either this config or the environment variable NODE_IP must be set.
  # node_ip = "10.180.1.1"

  ## Only for node scrape scope: interval in seconds for how often to get updated pod list for scraping.
  ## Default is 60 seconds.
  # pod_scrape_interval = 60

  ## Restricts Kubernetes monitoring to a single namespace
  ##   ex: monitor_kubernetes_pods_namespace = "default"
  # monitor_kubernetes_pods_namespace = ""
  # label selector to target pods which have the label
  # kubernetes_label_selector = "env=dev,app=nginx"
  # field selector to target pods
  # eg. To scrape pods on a specific node
  # kubernetes_field_selector = "spec.nodeName=$HOSTNAME"

  # cache refresh interval to set the interval for re-sync of pods list.
  # Default is 60 minutes.
  # cache_refresh_interval = 60

  ## Scrape Services available in Consul Catalog
  # [inputs.prometheus.consul]
  #   enabled = true
  #   agent = "http://localhost:8500"
  #   query_interval = "5m"

  #   [[inputs.prometheus.consul.query]]

  #     [inputs.prometheus.consul.query.tags]
  #       host = "{{.Node}}"

  ## Use bearer token for authorization. ('bearer_token' takes priority)
  # bearer_token = "/path/to/bearer/token"
  ## OR
  # bearer_token_string = "abc_123"

  ## HTTP Basic Authentication username and password. ('bearer_token' and
  ## 'bearer_token_string' take priority)
  # username = ""
  # password = ""

  ## Specify timeout duration for slower prometheus clients (default is 3s)
  # response_timeout = "3s"

  ## Optional TLS Config
  # tls_ca = /path/to/cafile
  # tls_cert = /path/to/certfile
  # tls_key = /path/to/keyfile

# Configuration for sending metrics to InfluxDB 2.0
[[outputs.influxdb_v2]]
  ## The URLs of the InfluxDB cluster nodes.
  ##
  ## Multiple URLs can be specified for a single cluster, only ONE of the
  ## urls will be written to each interval.
  ##   ex: urls = ["https://us-west-2-1.aws.cloud2.influxdata.com"]
  urls = ["http://10.70.90.82:8086"]

  ## Local address to bind when connecting to the server
  ## If empty or not set, the local address is automatically chosen.
  # local_address = ""

  ## Token for authentication.
  token = "{{ INFLUX_DB_TOKEN }}" 

  ## Organization is the name of the organization you wish to write to.
  organization = "nycmesh"

  ## Destination bucket to write into.
  bucket = "dns_monitoring"

  ## The value of this tag will be used to determine the bucket.  If this
  ## tag is not set the 'bucket' option is used as the default.
  # bucket_tag = ""

  ## If true, the bucket tag will not be added to the metric.
  # exclude_bucket_tag = false

  ## Timeout for HTTP messages.
  # timeout = "5s"

  ## Additional HTTP headers
  # http_headers = {"X-Special-Header" = "Special-Value"}

  ## HTTP Proxy override, if unset values the standard proxy environment
  ## variables are consulted to determine which proxy, if any, should be used.
  # http_proxy = "http://corporate.proxy:3128"

  ## HTTP User-Agent
  # user_agent = "telegraf"

  ## Content-Encoding for write request body, can be set to "gzip" to
  ## compress body or "identity" to apply no encoding.
  # content_encoding = "gzip"

  ## Enable or disable uint support for writing uints influxdb 2.0.
  # influx_uint_support = false

  ## When true, Telegraf will omit the timestamp on data to allow InfluxDB
  ## to set the timestamp of the data during ingestion. This is generally NOT
  ## what you want as it can lead to data points captured at different times
  ## getting omitted due to similar data.
  # influx_omit_timestamp = false

  ## HTTP/2 Timeouts
  ## The following values control the HTTP/2 client's timeouts. These settings
  ## are generally not required unless a user is seeing issues with client
  ## disconnects. If a user does see issues, then it is suggested to set these
  ## values to "15s" for ping timeout and "30s" for read idle timeout and
  ## retry.
  ##
  ## Note that the timer for read_idle_timeout begins at the end of the last
  ## successful write and not at the beginning of the next write.
  # ping_timeout = "0s"
  # read_idle_timeout = "0s"

  ## Optional TLS Config for use on HTTP connections.
  # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
  # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
  # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
  ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
